| --------- | --------------- |
| db_connect | it  specifies the database type and name .
| app | It is for initializing the flask applications.

### Methods used and Description
A database 'Student' has been created on AWS sqlite which contains the details regarding the students : Student ID, Name ,Major with Student ID as the primary key. Two Classes, Student and Students, have been created to manage the Students database.  Following methods have been implemented to access the resources.

The get(self) method returns the details of al the resources. The get(self, student_id) method returns the details of a specific resource identified by the primary key student_id.

### put() - The PUT() method updates the Student resources of a particular student using the primary key ‘student_id’ in the database.

### post() - The POST method is used to create a new resource in the Student database. It allows a new record to be added in the Student.
